I recently came across a paper by Donald E. Knuth that I found both intriguing and fun to read. In it, Knuth shares two small programs he wrote while working on TeX, his typesetting system.

   The first program, which he refers to as P1, converts a decimal fraction into an integer multiple of $2^{-16}$. He notes that the correctness of this program is easy to prove.

The second program goes in the other direction: given an integer n, where $0 < n < 2^{16}$, it finds a decimal fraction. This time, however, the correctness of the program isn’t straightforward. Knuth refers to this one as P2. How he uses invariants and constructs a proof of correctness is both fascinating and beautiful. I'll walk through both programs below, one by one.

But before that, a few words about the book where this paper appears.

The book is titled "Beauty is Our Business: A Birthday Salute to Edsger W. Dijkstra," edited by W.H.J. Feijen and others. It’s a tribute from Dijkstra’s friends and colleagues—people deeply influenced by his work. 

In the preface of the book, the editors write:

> In the end, on Dijkstra’s fifty-ninth birthday, we asked fifty-odd friends and colleagues of his to contribute to this birthday salute. We requested mainly technical contributions, and we asked that they be relatively short. Fifty-odd authors responded, and we are proud to place their contributions before Edsger Dijkstra.

The preface also includes a quote by Dijkstra that inspired the book’s title. It’s worth sharing:

> ...when we recognize the battle against chaos, mess, and unmastered complexity as one of computing science’s major callings, we must admit that beauty is our business.


Reading Knuth’s contribution has been not only educational but also deeply enlightening. In what follows, I’ll walk through the two programs he discusses in his paper, one by one—with one caveat. I only wish I were mathematically sophisticated enough to read Knuth with ease. The truth is, my mathematical background feels inadequate, and there’s still so much I need to learn.

Still, I did my best to unpack his paper and found it rewarding enough that I felt compelled to write about it and share what I’ve understood. I’m human, and I may have made mistakes—if you spot any, please feel free to email me, and I’ll be happy to correct them. 

## Convert decimal fraction to integer multiples of $2^{-16}$

TeX works internally with integer multiples of $2^{-16}$, so Knuth needed to write a routine to convert a decimal fraction like $0.d1d2...dk$ into the nearest integer multiple of $2^{-16}$. For example, given an input like 0.12408, the routine returns 8132.

It’s fascinating how Knuth approached the design of this program. Here’s a closer look at what he explains in the paper.

Since we’re trying to find the nearest integer multiple of $2^{-16}$, Knuth notes that we can round the following quantity:

$$
2^{16} \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{d_j}{10^j}
$$

to the nearest integer _n_. If two integers are equally near, we let _n_ be the integer:

$$
n = \left\lfloor 2^{16} \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{d_j}{10^j} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

To see how this works, consider the input $0.12408$:

$$
n = 2^{16} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{10^1} + \frac{2}{10^2} + \frac{4}{10^3} + \frac{0}{10^4} + \frac{8}{10^5} \right) + \frac{1}{2}
$$

This will give us $ n = 8132 $.

Knuth shares two important considerations at this point. 

First, since the input digits d<sub>j</sub> are small nonnegative integers, Knuth wanted to ensure that the intermediate results remained reasonably small.

Second, because k (the number of digits) can be arbitrarily large, he was concerned that the computations might exceed the limits of the computer’s hardware. He points out that 17 digits are not only sufficient—they are sometimes necessary to determine the correct value of n.
We can safely ignore _dj_ for _j > 17_. This level of attention to detail is a hallmark of Knuth’s approach and one of the reasons this program is so elegant. 

Here is this program, called P1, as outlined in the paper:

```
P1: l := min(k, 17); m := 0;

repeat m := (131072 * d[l] + m) div 10;
       l := l - 1;
until l = 0;

n := (m + 1) div 2
```

The following is a dry run of Program P1 using the input $0.12408$. The digits of this input are processed in reverse order, from d[5] to d[1]:

| Iteration | Current 'l' | d[l] | Updated 'm' | Updated 'l' |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 8 | 104857 | 4 |
| 2 | 4 | 0 | 10485 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | 53477 | 2 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | 31562 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 1 | 16263 | 0 |

---

The loop exits when l becomes zero, but there’s one final step left in Program P1. To complete the dry run, we take the value of m from the last row of the table—when l is zero—and use it to compute n:

$$
n = \frac{m + 1}{2} = \frac{16263 + 1}{2} = \frac{16264}{2} = 8132
$$

Thus, converting $0.12408$ using Program P1 produces $ n = 8132 $. 

Knuth notes that the proof for this one is straightforward: "We have m = m1 at the beginnning of the repeat loop, assuming that k <= 17; and 
we have shown that it is legitimate to replace k by 17 if k is larger."

## Converting the other way

Now we turn to the inverse problem: given an integer _n_, find a corresponding decimal fraction $0.d1d2...dk$
that approximates to $2^{-16}.n$ so closely that P1 will reproduce _n_ exactly. For example, if the input is $8132$, we should expect the output to be $0.12408$.

As Knuth notes, it is desirable to keep k as small as possible—to find the shortest decimal fraction that will reproduce the given value of n.

We also want to choose the fraction closest to $n / 2^{16}$. For example, both $0.0001$ and $0.0002$ yield $n = 1$, but we choose $0.0002$ because it is closer to 1.

Here is the program P2 as given in the paper:

```
P2: j := 0; s := 10 * n + 5; t := 10;
    repeat if t > 65536 then s := s + 32678 - (t div 2);
        j := j + 1; d[j] := s div 65536;
        s := 10 * (s mod 65536); t := 10 * t;
    until s <= t;
    k := j;
```

The following is a dry run of Program P2 on the input $n = 8132$. The values of s and t shown in the table reflect their updated state at the end of each iteration.

| Iteration | d[j] | s | t |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 157890 | 100 |
| 2 | 2 | 268180 | 1000 |
| 3 | 4 | 60360 | 10000 |
| 4 | 0 | 603600 | 100000 |
| 5 | 8 | 620800 | 1000000 |

---

So if you start with a decimal fraction like $0.12408$, the algorithm essentially extracts the digits one at a time—first the 1, then the 2, then the 4, followed by 0, and finally 8.

This fraction gradually reveals itself as a sequence of digits—with the help of carefully controlled values of s and t—until there’s no more meaningful information left to extract.


Knuth notes: 

"Why does this work? Everybody knows Dijkstra's famous dictum that testing can reveal the prescense of errors but not their absence. However, a program like this, with only finitely many inputs, is a counterexample! Suppose we test it for all 65536 values of 'n', and suppose the resulting fractions .d1 ... dk all reproduce the original value when converted back. Then we need only verify that none of the shorter fractions or neighboring fractions of equal length are better; this testing will prove the program correct.

But this testing is still not a good way to guarantee correctness, because it gives us no insight into generalizations. Therefore we seek a proof that is comprehensible and educational.

Even more, we seek a proof that reflects the ideas need to create the program, rather than a proof that was concocted ex post facto. The program didn't emerge by itself from a vacuum, nor did I simply try tall possible short programs until I found one that worked."

This is an important point. While we could write a unit test to check all $65,536$ possible values, that wouldn’t guarantee that none of the shorter fractions—or neighboring fractions of equal length—would perform better. 

Knuth sought a proof first, before writing the program. He wanted the program to emerge from the proof—not to force a proof to fit after the fact.

This shows that Program P2 emerged from careful thought, analysis, and design. The values of s and t didn’t come out of thin air—they were the result of deliberate reasoning and mathematical analysis. We’ll explore how shortly. What’s especially fascinating is how Knuth establishes invariants to ensure the correctness of the computed values. More on that below.

## Germs of Proof

### Step 1: Setting up the digit strings

Knuth notes: The set of digit strings $d_{j+1} d_{j+2} \dots d_k$ that produce a given result _n_ when preceded by $0.d_1 d_2 \dots d_j$ can be characterized as a set of decimal fractions:

$$
0.d_{j+1} \dots d_k
$$

This set falls within a certain half-open interval:

$$
[\alpha \dots \beta)
$$


Initially, we have $j = 0$ and this interval is:

$$
\left[2^{-16}\left(n - \frac{1}{2}\right), \, 2^{-16}\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
$$


Although Knuth is working with real numbers at this point, I was curious to see what the corresponding interval would look like for a specific integer. So, if $n = 8132$, the interval is:

$$
\bigl[\,2^{-16}\,(8132 - \tfrac12),\;2^{-16}\,(8132 + \tfrac12)\bigr)
$$

$$
= \bigl[\,0.12407,\; 0.12409\,\bigr)
$$


While it may not be entirely accurate to interpret this interval in terms of integers—since the analysis is meant for real numbers—what’s fascinating is how tight the interval is. Our expected output lies close to these values and falls within the interval, leaving little room for error.
### Step 2: Evolving the interval after each digit choice

If we have already chosen some digits, what are the valid choices for the remaining digits?

Knuth notes that permissible values of $d_{j+1}$ are decimal digits _d_ such that:

$$
\left[\frac{d}{10}, \, \frac{d+1}{10}\right)
$$

overlaps with:

$$
[\alpha .. \beta)
$$


### Step 3: Interval evolution after each new digit

After each digit is chosen, the interval is updated accordingly:

- Initially, it is:

$$
[\alpha .. \beta)
$$

- We select digit _d_

- We increment _j_, and after choosing _d_, the new interval evolves to:

$$
\left[10\alpha - d, \, 10\beta - d\right)
$$

This narrows down the possible values for the remaining digits.

Now comes another elegant aspect of the proof. While the reasoning above involves real numbers, Knuth wants to keep the implementation entirely in integers. To do this, he introduces the variables _s_ and _t_. The way this transition is handled—and how s and t naturally emerge from the analysis—has a beauty of its own. Beauty, after all, is Knuth’s business.

<details>

<summary>I was curious to see how this interval evolves in the case of the integer n = 8132. Click below to expand and view the detailed calculation.</summary>

<br/>
Initially, we start with:

$$
[\alpha, \beta] = [0.12407, 0.12409)
$$

As the interval evolves: <br/>

1. First update:  
   $$ [0.2407, 0.2409) $$

2. Second update:  
   $$ [0.407, 0.409) $$

3. Third update:
   $$ [0.07, 0.09) $$

4. Fourth update:
   $$ [0.07, 0.9) $$

5. Final update: 
   $$ [0, 0) $$

<br/>
This process illustrates how the interval gradually shifts to the left, narrowing step by step toward zero.

</details> 


## Representing the Interval with Integer Variables <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">_s_ and _t_</span>


Knuth introduces two integer variables to represent the interval boundaries more elegantly, allowing the use of integers instead of real numbers:

- _s_ represents the upper bound.
- _t_ represents the decimal scale.

He represents `α` and `β` using _s_ and _t_ as follows:

$$
10\alpha = 2^{-16}(s + t)
$$

$$
10\beta = 2^{-16}t
$$


The initial values of _s_ and _t_ are:

$$
s = 10n + 5, \quad t = 10
$$

### Invariant & Interval Evolution

Knuth shows that the invariant condition for each new digit _d_ is:

$$
0 \leq d \leq 9,\quad s > 2^{16}d,\quad s - t < 2^{16}d + 2^{16}
$$


This invariant relationship is important, as we’ll see further below. As I understand it, this is one of the key reasons we can trust the correctness of the results produced by Program P2. 

Each time we increment j and select a new digit d, the interval evolves, and we update s and t as follows:

$$
s = 10(s - 2^{-16}d)
$$

$$
t = 10t
$$

### Example

Let’s work through an example to see how the invariant—and the initial and updated values of s and t—help ensure the correctness of the result:

$$
n = 8192
$$

A summary of the calculations is presented in the table below. Detailed step-by-step calculations, corresponding to each row, follow immediately after the table.

This table illustrates how the permissible values for each digit d (in our decimal output) are determined by the invariants—referred to as Invariant 1 and Invariant 2—which are maintained through carefully chosen values of s and t at each step. Invariant 1 represents

$$
\quad s > 2^{16}d
$$

and _Invariant 2_ represents:

$$
\quad s - t < 2^{16}d + 2^{16}
$$

<h3> First Permissible digit </h3><br/>

Given that the initial values are:

$$
s = 81325, t = 10
$$

We've two inequalities to check:

$$ s > d \cdot 2^{16} $$ 

and 

$$ (s - t) < 2^{16} \cdot d + 2^{16} $$

Since:

$$2^{16} = 65536$$ 

Let's evaluate for $s = 81325$ and $t = 10$ and evaluate the first inequality:

$$
81325 > 65536 \cdot d
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d < \frac{81325}{65536} \approx 1.240
$$



Now evaluate the second inequality:

$$
81325 - 10 < 65536 \cdot d + 65536
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
81315 < 65536 \cdot (d+1)
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d+1 > \frac{81315}{65536} 
$$

which is about $0.234$ 

Thus:

$$
0.23 < d < 1.24
$$


Looks like $d = 1$ is the integer value (since Knuth is now dealing with integers) that satisfies above.

<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;">
	So using the invariant relationship above, we find that the first permissible digit is 1.
 </div> <br/>


<h3>  Second permissible digit </h3> <br/>

Now we need to update $s$ and $t$ to determine which digit satisfies the invariant next.

Now:

$$
s = 10 \cdot \left( 81325 - 2^{16} \cdot 1 \right), t = 100
$$

This evaluates to:

$$
s = 10 \cdot (81325 - 65536) = 10 \cdot 15789 = 157890
$$

$$
s - t = 157890 - 100 = 157790
$$

Let's now evaluate the first inequality: 

$$
157890 > 65536 \cdot d
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d < \frac{157890}{65536} \approx 2.409
$$



Now let's evaluate the second inequality:

$$
157790 < 65536 \cdot (d+1)
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d+1 > \frac{157790}{65536} 
$$



This gives:

$$
d > 1.407 
$$

So we've:
$$
1.40 < d < 2.40
$$

<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;">
This yields the next permissible digit: 2. I find it beautiful how the invariant continues to hold, guiding us step by step. It's now time to update s and t again.
</div> <br/>

<h3> Third Permissible Digit </h3> <br/>

Now:

$$
s = 10 \cdot \left(157890 - 2^{16} \cdot 2 \right), t = 1000
$$

This evaluates to:

$$
s = 10 \cdot (157890 - 2 \cdot 65536) = 10 \cdot (157890 - 131072) = 10 \cdot 26818 = 268180
$$

$$
s - t = 268180 - 1000 = 267180
$$

Let's evaluate the first inequality:

$$
268180 > 65536 \cdot d
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d < \frac{268180}{65536} \approx 4.092
$$

Let's evaluate the second inequality:

$$
267180 < 65536 \cdot (d+1)
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d+1 > \frac{267180}{65536}
$$

This gives:

$$
d > 3.076 
$$

So we've:

$$
3.07 < d < 4.09 
$$


<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;">So the next permissible digit is 4. Isn’t it beautiful how this invariant keeps revealing the next permissible digit, step by step? </div><br/>



<h3> Fourth Permissible Digit </h3> <br/>

Alright, it's time update $s$ and $t$ again. 

Now:

$$
s = 10 \cdot \left(268180 - 2^{16} \cdot 4 \right), t = 10000
$$

This evaluates to:

$$
s = 10 \cdot (268180 - 4 \cdot 65536) = 10 \cdot (268180 - 262144) = 10 \cdot 6036 = 60360
$$

$$
s - t = 60360 - 10000 = 50360
$$

Evalauting the first inequality we get:

$$
60360 > 65536 \cdot d
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d < \frac{60360}{65536} \approx 0.921
$$


Now the second inequality:

$$
50360 < 65536 \cdot (d+1)
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d+1 > \frac{50360}{65536} 
$$

This gives:

$$
d > -0.23
$$

So we've:

$$
-0.23 < d < 0.92
$$

<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;">
This gives us the next digit: 0. </div> <br/>

<h3> Fifth Permissible Digit </h3> <br/>

Let’s update $s$ and $t$ one final time to obtain the last digit.

$$
s = 10 \cdot \left(60360 - 2^{16} \cdot 0 \right), t = 100000
$$

Since:

$$
2^{16} \cdot 0 = 0
$$

This gives:

$$
s = 10 \cdot (60360 - 0) = 10 \cdot 60360 = 603600
$$

$$
s - t = 603600 - 100000 = 503600
$$

The first inequality is:

$$
s > d \cdot 2^{16}
$$

This becomes:

$$
603600 > 65536 \cdot d
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d < \frac{603600}{65536} \approx 9.21
$$


The second inequality is:

$$
s - t < 2^{16} \cdot d + 2^{16}
$$

This becomes:

$$
503600 < 65536 \cdot d + 65536
$$

Solving for $d$:

$$
d+1 > \frac{503600}{65536} 
$$

This gives:
$$
d > 6.684 
$$

So we've:

$$
6.84 < d < 9.21
$$

So the integer values of $d$ that satisfy the above are:

$$
d = 7, 8, 9
$$

<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; padding: 5px; display: inline-block;">
We could continue further, but for now let’s complete the chain of calculations to arrive at our answer: 0.12408.. </div><br/>


<hr/>

</details>

The output we want is $0.12408$. The permissible _d_ in the first step matches exactly the first digit of our expected output. The next permissible d gives us the second digit, and the third and fourth permissible d values again match the expected digits. For the final digit, the permissible values form a narrow range—from which the last digit of the output is selected.

The idea of maintaining an invariant to govern the permissibility of the next output digit is fascinating. At each step, the permissible values of _d_ are remarkably close to the actual digit required at that point in the output—greatly reducing the likelihood of an incorrect value. 

Next, Knuth addresses how to optimally choose the fifth decimal digit in P2—that is, the “best possible” option among the available choices. We’ll see in just a moment why the fifth digit is significant, and why this adjustment matters. 

To optimally select the fifth decimal digit, Knuth adjusts the value of _s_ using the following conditional statement in P2:

```if (t > 65536) then (s := s + 32768 - (t div 2));```

In P2, after the first four iterations, given the input 'n = 8132', we have:


$$ d[1] = 1, d[2] = 2, d[3] = 4, d[4] = 0 $$

And the values of _s_ and _t_ are:

s = 603600, t = 100000

If we use these values of _s_ and _t_ without applying the adjustment (as defined in the conditional above), we would get 'd[5] = 9'. But is 9 really the best choice for the fifth digit? So we know that: 

$$
\frac{8132}{2^{16}} = 0.12408447265625
$$


We can see that 0.12408 is closer to the true value than 0.12409 in this case.

So, 8 is a better choice for d[5] than 9 from a correctness standpoint—and this is why the fifth digit matters. It’s fascinating how Knuth ensures optimal rounding by applying the conditional adjustment when choosing d[5]. 

One final thing I wanted to understand was how Knuth derived the following if expression:

```if (t > 65536) then (s := s + 32768 - (t div 2));```

The idea of adding 32768 and subtracting 't div 2' is fascinating on its own—but I was genuinely surprised. How did Knuth come up with that?

Based on a couple of close readings of the final sections of the paper, I’ve tried to reconstruct Knuth’s reasoning. After working through the invariants and equations he presents, I’ve outlined my understanding in the collapsible section below.

<details>

<summary> How was `if (t > 65536) then (s := s + 32768 - (t div 2));` derived? </summary>

<br>
Knuth explains that we want to compute the quantity:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{10^5 n}{2^{16}} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

rounded to five decimal places, whenever no suitable approximation with fewer than 5 decimal places exists.

He also states that the variables

$$
s \quad \text{and} \quad d_1 \ldots d_j
$$

(where 'j' is the number of computed digits so far)


obey the following invariant relationship, stated in section 4 of the paper:

$$
\frac{s}{10^{j+1}} + 2^{16} \sum_{i=1}^{j} \frac{d_i}{10^i} = n + \frac{1}{2} \tag{1}
$$

To compute the fifth decimal digit, we set $j = 4$.

Equation (1) then becomes:

$$
\frac{s}{10^5} + 2^{16} \sum_{i=1}^{4} \frac{d_i}{10^i} = n + \frac{1}{2} \tag{2}
$$

Ideally, we want the right-hand side of (2) to match the following expression, since—as noted above—this is the quantity Knuth aims to compute:

$$
\frac{10^5 n}{2^{16}} + \frac{1}{2}
$$

To reach that form, we multiply both sides of (2) by $10^5$:

$$
s + 2^{16} \sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i} = 10^5 n + \frac{10^5}{2} \tag{3}
$$

Now subtract $10^{5}/2$ from both sides:

$$
s - \frac{10^5}{2} + 2^{16} \sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i} = 10^5 n \tag{4}
$$

Now add $2^{15}$ to both sides:


$$
s - \frac{10^5}{2} + 2^{15} + 2^{16} \sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i} = 10^5 n + 2^{15} \tag{5}
$$

To align the right-hand side with the expression:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{10^5 n}{2^{16}} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

We divide equation (5) by $2^{16}$:

$$
\frac{s'}{2^{16}} + \sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i} = \frac{10^5 n}{2^{16}} + \frac{1}{2}
$$

where:

$$
s' = s + 2^{15} - \frac{10^5}{2}
$$

Then:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{s'}{2^{16}} + \sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i} \right\rfloor = \sum_{i=1}^{5} d_i \cdot 10^{5 - i}
$$

So s' gives the correct value for the fifth decimal digit.

When $j = 4$ we have $t = 10^{5}$ so the key expression becomes:

$$
s' = s + 2^{15} - \frac{10^5}{2}
$$

Hence, we get:

$$
s := s + 32768 - \left\lfloor \frac{t}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

Which corresponds to:

$$
s := s + 32768 - \frac{t}{2} \quad \text{when } t = 10^5
$$

And that corresponds exactly to the statement inside that 'if' expression.

</details>

To conclude, two elegant insights emerge from examining the correctness of P2:

- How the invariant relationship governs the permissibility of each decimal digit in the output is remarkable. For the output $.d1d2d3d4d5$, the invariant ensures the correctness of d1, then d2, then d3, followed by d4, and finally d5. This step-by-step scrupulous precision is nothing short of beautiful. The pursuit of precision, in itself, is often beautiful. 

- How Knuth uses the invariant to determine the exact statement needed (in the 'if' statement above) to correctly select the final digit.

- 	How the proof elegantly and optimally handles the rounding of the fifth digit.
 

Knuth left no crucial detail unaddressed.

Every part of the program is critically analyzed and evaluated for correctness. As a programmer, what inspires me most is Knuth’s level of attention to detail—and the example he sets in identifying invariants for each crucial part of the algorithm. It inspires one to aim for the same in my own work 

Yes, unit testing is essential—as is analysis supported by formal methods and model checkers. But carefully identifying invariants, especially for critical sections of code, is just as important. I say this after spending a few days last week chasing a bug that slipped through unit tests and likely wouldn’t have been caught by high-level model-checking abstractions. In hindsight, the whole team agreed that a well-defined invariant could have prevented it.

Out of curiosity, I implemented both P1 and P2 in Python. You can find the code in this GitHub repository: [knuth-beauty-is-his-business](https://github.com/wyounas/knuth-beauty-is-his-business).
