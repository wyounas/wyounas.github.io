<p>Welcome to my blog :)</p> 
<p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about writing, technology, and 
    other topics that interest me. 

    These days, I am also exploring new work opportunities in the tech world. I have over 15 years of experience working in software companies as both a founder and an engineer.
</p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes, I write about technical topics to understand them better. In other words, 
        I’m just trying to follow Confucius’ advice: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”</p>
