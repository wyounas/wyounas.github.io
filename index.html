<p>Welcome to my blog :)</p> 
<p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about writing, technology, model checking and formal methods, and 
    other topics that interest me. 

    </p>
    <p>Sometimes, I write about technical topics to understand them better. In other words, 
        I’m just trying to follow Confucius’ advice: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”</p>

    <p>

    I’ve spent much of my career helping build and scale software systems, both as a founder and an engineer at companies like HubSpot and Customer.io.

I’m fascinated by how large systems work–and fail. I enjoy learning about distributed systems, formal verification, and the craft of reliable and good quality software.
